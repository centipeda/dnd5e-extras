While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success.

Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher).</strong> Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer.

If you already have an artificial mind from this feature, the first one immediately dissipates.</p>\n<p>The magic item has the following properties:</p>\n<p><strong>Telepathic Advisor.</strong> The artificial mind telepathically supplies you with advice and information about certain topics: while the item is on your person, you have proficiency in two skills of your choice; the item's main material determines which skills you can choose from, as shown on the Artificial Mind table in the Skill Proficiencies column, for the nature of the object affects the mind's knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Manifest Mind.</strong> As a bonus action while the item is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral presence, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. This presence is intangible and invulnerable, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. You determine its appearance; the Artificial Mind table offers suggested appearances based on the object's main material. While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. As an action, you can hear and see using the mind's senses, instead of your own, until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects. The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from its magic item or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>When you cast an artificer spell on your turn,you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (at least once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Information Overload.</strong> As an action while the item is on your person, you can try to magically overload the thoughts of one creature you or the mind can see that is within 5 feet of the manifested mind, channeling a jumble of information from the artificial mind. Unless the target succeeds on an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage, and the next attack roll against it before the end of your next turn has advantage, since it is temporarily too distracted to defend itself well. The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level(3d8), and 17th level (4d8) in this class. Whenever you deal damage with this feature,you can expend a spell slot to deal extra damage to the target. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than first.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc4\"><span>Artificial Mind</span></h4>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Main Material</th>\n<th>Skill Proficiencies</th>\n<th>Suggested Appearance</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Animal (parchment, leather, bone)</td>\n<td>Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival</td>\n<td>A beast or a humanoid visage with antlers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mineral (glass, stone, metal)</td>\n<td>Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion</td>\n<td>A robotic or golem-like face</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Plant (paper, wood)</td>\n<td>Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion</td>\n<td>A bespectacled visage or a treant</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Unearthed Arcana 58 - Artificer","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"img":"","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1681171237.040437,"modifiedTime":1681171237.0404372,"lastModifiedBy":"dnd5ebuilder0000"}}

The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic.</p>\n<p>If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Banishing Arrow.</em></strong> You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p>\n<p>After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Beguiling Arrow.</em></strong> Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.</p>\n<p>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Bursting Arrow.</em></strong> You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The arrow detonates after your attack. Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each.</p>\n<p>The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Enfeebling Arrow.</em></strong> You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Grasping Arrow.</em></strong> When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.</p>\n<p>The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Piercing Arrow.</em></strong> You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</p>\n<p>The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Seeking Arrow.</em></strong> Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.</p>\n<p>The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Shadow Arrow.</em></strong> You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Xanathar's Guide to Everything","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"img":"","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1681171236.7556388,"modifiedTime":1681171236.755639,"lastModifiedBy":"dnd5ebuilder0000"}}

As an action, you expend and roll a Bardic Inspiration die. For the next 10 minutes, any creatures of your choice within 60 feet cannot be surprised, and gain a bonus on saving throws against traps and environmental hazards equal to your Bardic Inspiration die roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Crash (Marcato).</strong> You learn how to harness and amplify the roar of a well-placed blow into a violent explosion of sound. When a creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you hits with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend and roll a Bardic Inspiration die. The target of the triggering attack must make a Strength saving throw against your Spell save DC or take thunder damage equal to half of the number you rolled and be knocked prone.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dirge of Dread (Finale).</strong> You play a terrifying dirge to accompany a deathblow, striking fear into the hearts of your nearby enemies.

Select a number of creatures within 15 feet of the triggering ally equal to half of the number rolled (minimum 1).

After the effect ends, or the save is successful, targeted creatures are immune to Dirge of Dread for the next 24 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dissonance (Discordia).</strong> Summoning a harsh, discordant tone, you muddle the mind of an opponent, lessening their defenses. When a creature within 60 feet is forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend and roll a Bardic Inspiration die. You reduce their saving throw by half of the number rolled. You can use this feature after the creature makes its saving throw roll, but before the DM determines a success or failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Guiding Tone (Fermata).</strong> You drag a sharp, powerful chord through the mind of a creature, forcing it to suddenly stumble in a direction you wish. As a bonus action, you expend and roll a Bardic Inspiration die and select a creature other than yourself within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell save DC or take psychic damage equal to half of the number rolled and be pushed 10 feet in a direction you choose. A target can fail the saving throw voluntarily.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hasten Tempo (Accelerando).</strong> Your manipulation of tempo and song can inspire others to act more quickly. You can use your Bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet. Expend and roll a Bardic Inspiration die, adding the number rolled to the creature's initiative and moving them up to the initiative order accordingly. If this would move them higher than you, they immediately take their turn after you finish this round. A creature cannot be affected by Hasten Tempo again until they've finished a short or long rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hymm of Harmony (Armonia).</strong> The melodies surrounding your allies promote rapid recovery. When a creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you regains any hitpoints, they can expend and roll their inspiration die to regain additional hitpoints equal to the number rolled.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Majestic Anthem (Maestoso).</strong> Pulled from the chaos, you muster an uplifting melody that bolsters the resolve of your allies.

These temporary hitpoints last until the end of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Resonance (Risonanza).</strong> You shape the harmonic vibrations of a weapon's movements into a dangerous, sonic enhancement. Using a bonus action, you can expend and roll a Bardic Inspiration die, choosing one weapon within 60 feet of you. Until the end of your next turn, all attacks with that weapon deal additional thunder damage equal to half of the number rolled (minimum of 1).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sprint (Presto).</strong> The song you conjure can stir the winds, pushing along those who require expedient travel. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can expend and roll their inspiration to increase their speed for that turn.
