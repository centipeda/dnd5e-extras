The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the creature's body instantly forms.</p>\n<p>You determine the homunculus's appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.</p>\n<p>The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>\n<p>In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\n<p>The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space.</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th colspan=\"6\">Homunculus Servant</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><em>Tiny construct</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 13 (natural armor)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 1 + your Intelligence modifier + your artificer level (the homunculus has a number of Hit Dice [d4s] equal to your artificer level)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Speed:</strong> 20 ft., fly 30 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>STR</th>\n<th>DEX</th>\n<th>CON</th>\n<th>INT</th>\n<th>WIS</th>\n<th>CHA</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 (-3)</td>\n<td>15 (+2)</td>\n<td>12 (+1)</td>\n<td>10 (+0)</td>\n<td>10 (+0)</td>\n<td>7 (−2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dex +2 plus PB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Skills:</strong> Perception +0 plus PB x 2, Stealth +2 plus PB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Condition Immunities:</strong> exhaustion, poisoned</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Senses:</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10 + (PB x 2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Languages:</strong> understands the languages you speak</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Challenge:</strong> —</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Proficiency Bonus (PB):</strong> equals your bonus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong><em>Evasion.</em></strong> If the homunculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
