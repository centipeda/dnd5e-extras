The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster's spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses. Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents' attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters' magical energy against them. In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense.

{"name":"Bard: Satire (UA)","type":"subclass","img":"","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king's royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand's affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm's cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh. While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester's barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth. For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester's satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her. Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist's treachery or exposing a baron's plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm. Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies' spirits while casting doubt into foes' minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Unearthed Arcana 12 - Kits of Old","identifier":"satire-ua","classIdentifier":"bard","advancement":[{"_id":"A4R1glMkVdzKucpK","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures-extra.DOZ3SRILpVYXus0f"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Bonus Proficiencies"},{"_id":"N4jK7Zmyzrzvb8jP","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures-extra.kybwpFCU63S534NX"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Tumbling Fool"},{"_id":"GWLyDXjI4YzeGeTt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures-extra.u6fnshVCuZj62Dqm"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Fool's Insight"},{"_id":"sCD3GBrsWkHsZsgh","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures-extra.IXAwjANSIMCQqIO3"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Fool's Luck"}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{},"_id":"yy4Hk2I2xvDrnShm","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1681171236.672519,"modifiedTime":1681171236.6725192,"lastModifiedBy":"dnd5ebuilder0000"}}
