For some sorcerers, the body becomes a conduit for this power, which is collected and stored in the form of natural runes — and which sees a sorcerer named as a Runechild. The talents of a Runechild are rare, and sorcerers with this origin are sought after for study by mages and scholars alike, driven by a prevalent belief that the secrets of their runes can help understand the mysteries of magic. Others sometimes seek to enslave Runechild sorcerers, using their bodies as tortured spell batteries for diabolic pursuits.
